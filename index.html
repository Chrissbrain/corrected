        <h1>My Goal and Aim for webdev course</h1><hr>
        <p><b />My aim and objective as a participant<br /> 
            in a web development course is to build<br /> 
            a strong foundation in coding and programming<br />
            to be able to launch into a successful software<br /> 
            development career and compete with <br />
            other tech giants out there. Along the way, I am <br />
            open to opportunities for remote work that <br />
            will allow me to gather practical<br /> 
            experience while earning a living and working <br />
            towards my long-term goal.</p><hr>
